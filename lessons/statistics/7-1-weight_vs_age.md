[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

>>For the Age of mother and weight of baby comparison, we take the example formulas from chapter 7's weight vs height comparison and find that the Pearson correlation is below .07 signialing little to no linear correlation.  Meanwhile the Spearman correlation is slightly better at .09 but not much when trying to infer any real type of correlation.

This can be verified when we plot the scatter plot of the relationship
