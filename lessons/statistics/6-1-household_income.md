[Think Stats Chapter 6 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2007.html#toc60) (household income)

>> Running the mean and median calculations as given by the author we see a nearly 23,000 skew to the upside with with mean well above the median and thats holding the top income stagnant at a million (which isn't correct, Hello Jeff Bezos).  

The skewness is confirmed with its positive value with the author's elegant python calculator.

Using the Probability capability in the CDF function given in the chapter and putting the mean in there it shows that nearly 2/3 of the country's households are under this mean threshold
