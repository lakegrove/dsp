[Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2004.html#toc31) (actual vs. biased)

>> There is an absolutely massive difference in the 0 kids observed vs actual of nearly .40 or 40% when comparing actual vs observed with observed having zero instances of 0 children.  The balance of that 40% is restributed primarily from the 2-5 kid range, with nearly 20% of that hovering in an offset of 2 kids probability vs 2 kid actual.
